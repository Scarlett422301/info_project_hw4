## My project

For my project, I will analyze the `CA_ED_INFO550` data.

To analyze the data you will need to install some `R` packages. You can open R under this folder, and use `renv::restore()` to synchronize your local project directory.

## Execute the analysis

To execute the analysis, from the project folder you can run 

``` bash
make
```

This will create a file called `report.pdf` output under the Rmd directory that contains the analysis results.
